# Contributing to OpenWebRTC

OpenWebRTC is still a relatively young project. Our ambition is to create an even more vibrant 
and open community where our team from Ericsson Research is just one of many contributors. 

We welcome all types of contributions, such as:

- Code
- Bug reports
- Documentation improvements
- Feature requests
- ...

 If you would like to start working on a new feature, that you intend to include in the OpenWebRTC 
 project, we encourage you to reach out first so that we can avoid potential duplicate efforts:
